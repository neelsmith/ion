# An approach to reading Greek

## 1. Reading Greek simple and compound sentences

*Clauses*

- A *simple sentence* has a main clause with a finite verb (expressed or implied).
- A *compound sentence* has multiple main clauses join by a conjunction (e.g., καί) or a particle (e.g., δέ).

**Reading clauses**

- *particles* guide you to group *clauses*
- the *definite article* helps you group *noun phrases*
- the *principal part* of a verb tells you *tense* and *voice* of all verb forms (finite, infinitive, participle)
- the *ending* of a *finite verb* tells you *person, number, mood*
- the *ending* of a *substantive* (noun, pronoun, adjective) tells you the *gender, case, number*


## 2. Reading complex sentences

*Complex sentences* have a main clause, plus one or more subordinate *verbal units*.  The most natural English equivalent of a subordinate verbal unit is a *dependent clause* introduced by a conjunction.  

> 👍 *Make a habit of expressing Greek verbal units with English clauses*.



### Verbal units

*Verbal units* express a verbal idea with a subject (possibly implied).  The main kinds of subordinate *verbal unit* are:

| Unit | Subject | Verb | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Dependent clause* | Nominative case (if expressed) | finite verb | introduced by a conjunction |
| *Indirect statement* with verbs of speaking | accusative case (if expressed) | infinitive | corresponds to English clause introduced by  "that" |
| *Indirect statement* with verbs of perception | accusative case (if expressed) | participle | corresponds to English clause introduced by  "that" |
| *Attributive participle* | case determined by usage of (pro)noun in sentence | participle agrees in case with  subject | in attributive position; corresponds to English relative clause |
| *Circumstantial participle* | case determined by usage of (pro)noun in sentence, or genitive case if not syntactically connected | participle agrees in case with  subject | can express any or several of time, circumstance, causation, concession,... |
